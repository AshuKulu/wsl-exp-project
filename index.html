                            NEW DELHI: Lieutenant General Manoj Pande has been named as the next chief of the Indian Army.
                            He will take over from incumbent COAS (Chief of the Army Staff) General MM Naravane, who is due to retire by the end of this month.
                            Lt Gen Pande will be the first-ever officer commissioned into the Corps of Engineers to become the Army chief. He is the senior most in the 
                            force after General Naravane and serving as the Vice Chief of the Army Staff. Lt Gen Pande was commissioned into the Bombay Sappers in December 1982 
                            In his distinguished career, he has held several prestigious command and staff assignments in conventional as well as counter-insurgency operations in all types of terrain.

                            NEW DELHI: He hasn't scored a hundred in more than two years, his overall scoring form has dropped, and despite all his efforts he continues to struggle 
                            to get big scores. Despite all these, modern day batting great, Virat Kohli remained the best batter for India even in the last couple of years. 
                            The description-'the only batter with 50-plus average in all three formats - doesn't hold true anymore for the former India captain, as Kohli's Test 
                            average ha gone down below 50 after a long time (49.95 to be precise). Despite the dip, experts and fans admit that he hasn't really lost form, is hitting 
                            the ball well and timing his shots perfectly, but somehow the big scores continue to elude a batter who at one time was the most prolific batter in international cricket.

                            LUCKNOW: The possibility of a fourth wave of Covid-19 in India remains low, believes IIT Kanpur professor Manindra Agarwal, 
                            whose mathematical model has been a reference point for understanding the pandemic activity and behaviour in the country over the past two years. 
                            Talking to TOI on Sunday, he said: "The surge in Covid-19 cases is not building up the fourth wave, as of now." On the reason for surge in cases 
                            in several states, including Delhi and NCR districts of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad of UP, he said. "The present rise in cases appears to be 
                            the result of lifting of curbs. It looks like a result of life returning to normalcy."

                            <br><br>KGF 2 Review: 'KGF:Chapter 1' set the tone for a slick gangster franchise-high on style and details. The first part was all about establishing 
                            the intentions and power of Raja Krishnappa Bairya aka Rocky Bhai. The second part has managed to create hype with its promotional content that 
                            gives a peek into the film. Does the film manage to match the build-up? It does and provides a better sequel and also has a big surprise for fans in the end, too.
